This project explores the Nigerian used-car market, where subjective pricing and limited market transparency make it difficult for buyers, sellers, and dealerships to determine fair and competitive vehicle prices.

##### Business Overview

The Nigerian used-car market is largely **opaque and inefficient**, with vehicle prices often set subjectively based on seller perception, negotiation power, or incomplete market information. This lack of pricing transparency leads to several challenges: buyers struggle to know whether a car is fairly priced, sellers risk underpricing or overpricing their vehicles, and dealerships face difficulties maintaining consistent and competitive pricing strategies.

As online automobile marketplaces and dealerships expand in Nigeria, there is a growing need for a **data-driven pricing tool** that can estimate the fair market value of a vehicle based on its characteristics,such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and condition.

The business problem, therefore, is:

> **How can we accurately predict the market price of cars in Nigeria using historical vehicle data to support better pricing decisions for buyers, sellers, and dealerships?**

Solving this problem would enable:

* Sellers to set competitive and realistic asking prices
* Buyers to make informed purchasing decisions and avoid overpaying
* Dealerships and online platforms to standardize pricing and improve market trust

This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to historical car listings in Nigeria to build a predictive model that estimates vehicle prices based on relevant features, ultimately improving transparency and efficiency in the automotive market.

### Data

The data used in this project was collected from Cars45.com, a popular online platform in Nigeria that connects buyers and sellers in the used-car market.

With this project, we have built a model that can predict the price of cars, given a set of features. 

This information can have an enormous value for both companies and individuals when trying to understand how to estimate the value of their vehicles.

The art of pricing is not an easy task and is sometimes only done by experts in the field, but with the study of historical data, it is possible to find patterns using machine learning that lead to results just as good.

 Acquiring this knowledge can provide you with a comparative advantage before putting a vehicle on sale or buying it on the market.
